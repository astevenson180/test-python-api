# First test api

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a continuation of my learning in python. This is an api from the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMppyAPbLYk)

This was written in pycharm and uses the following moduals: 
* requests
* flask
* flaskREST-ful

Install pycharm community edition [HERE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) to see the code in the IDE.

To install this program:
* Download the zip file and extract it.
* The file should save as test-python-api-master.
* Remove -master from the end of the file so it reads as test-python-api

To run this api and see a response:
* Go to the api folder
* Run new_api_test.py to start the server
* A console window will open showing the server information
* Then run test_file_api.py to get a response to server
* A window will open and close 
* Go back to the console window you opened from new_api_test.py 
* request information should show up
