# First test api

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a continuation of my learning in python. This is an api from the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMppyAPbLYk)

This was written in pycharm and uses the following moduals:
  
* requests
* flask
* flaskREST-ful


To run this api and see a response:
* Go to the api folder
* Run new_api_test.py to start the server
* Then run test_file_api.py to get a response to server
