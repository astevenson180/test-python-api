**Version 1.0.0**

This is a continuation of my learning in python. This is an api from the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMppyAPbLYk)

This was written in pycharm and uses the following moduals: 
* requests
* flask
* flaskREST-ful


## Installing the program

To install this program:
* Download the zip file and extract it.
* The file should save as test-python-api-master.
* Remove -master from the end of the file so it reads as test-python-api


## First steps
If you have a python environment already setup feel free to skip to the next section.

If you do not have python installed click [HERE](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to get the latest version

Install pycharm community edition [HERE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows).

To install this program:
* Download the zip file and extract it.
* The file should save as test-python-api-master.
* Remove -master from the end of the file so it reads as test-python-api

Once files are downloaded
* Open new_api_test.py in pycharm
* At the top right cornor select the button that says "Add python interpretor"
* select the file location where you downloaded python(not pycharm, but python from the first link)

Installing the moduals:
* Once the files are open in pycharm select new_api_test.py tab.
* Select File - settings - Project: test_file_api.py - Project interpreter
* press the plus button(+) and a search window that says "Available Packages" will open
* you will need to add a total of three moduals to this
* flask

* requests
* Select each one and press install package


## To run this api and see a response:
* Run new_api_test.py to start the server
* Then run test_file_api.py to get a response to server
* You should be getting a 200 response from the server when you run this program
